# How to install

```
- Navigate to .vscode/extensions/
  - .vscode can be found in the user folder, for example C:/Users/{username}/.vscode/extensions on windows
- Clone this repo to this folder
- Rename the folder to something like "simple-dark-0.1.0", otherwise VS code does not recognise it?
- Restart VS Code
